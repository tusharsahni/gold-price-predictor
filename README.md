# GoldTrends
This project is a web application for predicting gold prices based on several financial inputs, including USO, SLV, SPX, and EUR/USD. The application provides an interactive interface for users to input these values and get real-time predictions of gold prices. Additionally, it includes features like historical data visualization, model performance metrics, and user authentication.

## Home Page
The home page contains a form where users can input the values for USO, SLV, SPX, and EUR/USD. Upon submission, the form sends these values to the backend, which processes them and returns the predicted gold price along with model performance metrics.

## Prediction Results
The results page displays the predicted gold price and includes Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R²) to provide insight into the model's performance.

## Historical Data Visualization
The website also features historical data visualization, allowing users to see trends in gold prices and the input features (USO, SLV, SPX, EUR/USD) using interactive charts.

Features
Gold Price Prediction: Predict gold prices based on input features.
Model Performance Metrics: Display MAE, RMSE, and R² to evaluate the model.

Historical Data Visualization: Visualize historical trends of gold prices and input features.

## Future Improvements
News Integration: Include the latest financial news that could impact gold prices.

Customizable Forecasting: Allow users to adjust forecasting parameters and view predictions accordingly.

Additional Features: Add more features such as interest rates and inflation rates.

Export Options: Provide options for users to export prediction data and charts in various formats.

Feedback Mechanism: Add a feedback form for users to provide suggestions and report issues.

Educational Content: Include articles and tutorials about the factors influencing gold prices.
